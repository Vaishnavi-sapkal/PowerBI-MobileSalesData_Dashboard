## Problem Statement

Mobile sales data from multiple brands and cities is stored in Excel, making it difficult to extract insights. Business teams struggle to:

- Compare brand-wise and model-wise performance  
- Identify top-selling cities and months  
- Understand payment preferences across customers  
- Track customer ratings  
- Analyze demographic patterns  
- Monitor daily, monthly, and yearly sales trends

The objective of this project is to create an **interactive Power BI dashboard** that simplifies decision-making by converting raw Excel data into meaningful visual insights.
